Because nglview_ creates interactive widgets in a `Jupyter notebook`_, you need to run the examples as interactive notebooks.
Therefore, the examples are provided as links to mybinder_ interactive notebooks.

The notebooks will load with existing output, but in order to get functioning widgets you need to restart them and run them cell-by-cell.

  - struct_widget_: Create a colored nglview_ structure widget in a `Jupyter notebook`_.
